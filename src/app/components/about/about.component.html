      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <span>Alejandro</span> and I am <span>20 years old</span>. I
        became interested in the world of development when I was 15 years old,
        which prompted me to decide to
        <span>study information systems engineering</span>, a career in which I
        am currently in my penultimate year. Parallel to this, I am developing
        my skills for Front End development with
        <span>HTML, CSS and Angular</span> as my first Framework.
